# Icons Folder

This folder is for storing extension icons.

## Required Icons

You need to prepare icons in the following three sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have icon files yet, you can:

1. Use online icon generator tools to create simple icons
2. Or temporarily comment out the icons configuration in manifest.json

## Icon Design Suggestions

- Use lock or key related icon designs
- Keep it simple and clear
- Use contrasting colors
